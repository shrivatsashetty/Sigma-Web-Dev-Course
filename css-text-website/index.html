			<p id="txt-format-box-p1">
				The text in this box uses various text formatting properties.
                The para itself starts with an text-indent.
                The heading uses text-shadow, text-transform, text-indent.
                The entire paragraph is justified, also the last line,
                which is justified to center.
                The para uses a combination of contrasting background-color and text color.
                The line spacing is set to 2.5, word spacng to 6px and the text spacing set to 3px.
                The default underline has been removed from the following link:
				<a target="_blank" href="https://google.com">google.com</a>
                and a wavy line-through is added instead.
                Similarly we can also add 
                <span class="txt-underline">underline</span>
                <span class="txt-underline paranthesis-txt">(on hover)</span>
                or an
                <span class="txt-overline">overline</span>
                and also set the text-decoration-style.
